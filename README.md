# My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site is designed to showcase my work and provide an easy way for potential clients, employers, or collaborators to get in touch with me.

The website consists of two main pages: **Home** and **Contact**. Itâ€™s built with **HTML** and **CSS** to provide a clean, responsive layout.

## Pages

1. **Home**:  
   The homepage introduces me, highlights my skills, and provides a brief overview of what I do.
   
2. **Contact**:  
   The contact page allows visitors to reach out to me directly via a simple form. It includes a placeholder for future backend functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the website.
- **CSS**: Styling, layout, and responsiveness.
- **Responsive Design**: The website adapts well to both desktop and mobile devices.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the homepage, or open `contact.html` to view the contact page.

## Planned Features

- Adding a backend for the contact form.

- Expanding the site with additional pages and project showcases.

## Contact

You can reach me through the contact form on the website, or via email or LinkedIn.
